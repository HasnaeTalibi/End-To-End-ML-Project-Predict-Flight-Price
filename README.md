# End-To-End-ML-Project-Predict-the-Flight-Price

## Overview
In this project, the objective is to predict the flight's price based on various features like Departure Date, Source, Stopage, ....The data set that has used in this project has taken from the kaggle. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict the flight prices, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.


## Learning Objective
The following points were the objective of the project (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)

- Load the Data 
- Descriptive Analysis
- Data Visualizations
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Modelling
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

## Technical Aspect
Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.
A user has to put details like Depature date, destination, source,.. .
Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Numpy, Pandas, seaborn, sklearn, ...)
- Flask
- Heruko
